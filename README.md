# The Liberty Profile Arduino Feature

The Arduino Feature for the Liberty Profile enables interacting with Arduino microcontrollers from your Java EE application code running on Liberty. This enables building Internet of Things style systems which combine the features of the Liberty server with cheap and easy to use Arduino components for interacting with the real world.

The Liberty Arduino feature provides a Java API which is designed in a way which makes it familiar and easy to use by anyone who has coded Arduino sketches. It uses a Firmata style protocol for comunicating with Arduinos, which may be directly connected to the Liberty server via USB connections, or connected wirelessly by using one of the many different types of Arduino wireless accessories.

## Installation

The Arduino feature has two pieces - a .esa file that is installed into Liberty runtime, and a .zip file of the Liberty library that is installed into the Arduino IDE.
